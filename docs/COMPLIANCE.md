|---------|------------|--------|---------------|
| Art. 15 | Right to access | Missing | `GET /users/{id}/data-export` — return all user data as JSON |
| Art. 17 | Right to erasure | Partial | Soft delete exists. Need hard delete with cascade to sessions, tokens, identities |
| Art. 20 | Right to portability | Missing | Export user data in machine-readable format (JSON/CSV) |
| Art. 25 | Privacy by design | Partial | Encryption exists. Need data minimization policy |

| Art. 32 | Security of processing | Done | AES-256-GCM, bcrypt, TLS via proxy, per-tenant isolation |
| Art. 33 | Breach notification | Missing | Need audit logging + alerting for suspicious activity |
| Art. 7 | Consent management | Missing | Record what user consented to, when, allow withdrawal |
| N/A | DPA (Data Processing Agreement) | Missing | Legal document, not code |

| Fix Priority | Items | Effort |
|-------------|-------|--------|
