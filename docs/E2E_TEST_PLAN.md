- [ ] Only scopes allowed for the client are included

---

## 6. Refresh Token Grant

### 6.1 Basic Refresh
- [ ] `POST /token` with `grant_type=refresh_token` returns new access_token + new refresh_token
- [ ] New refresh token replaces old one (rotation)
- [ ] Old refresh token is invalidated after rotation

### 6.2 Replay Detection
- [ ] Using a rotated (old) refresh token revokes the entire token family
- [ ] After family revocation, even the latest refresh token is invalid

### 6.3 Revocation
- [ ] `POST /revoke` with refresh token invalidates it

- [ ] Clients on tenant A are not visible on tenant B
- [ ] Tokens issued for tenant A are invalid on tenant B
- [ ] JWKS returns different keys for different tenants

### 10.2 Tenant Resolution
- [ ] Header mode: `X-Tenant-ID` header resolves tenant
- [ ] Domain mode: `Host` header resolves tenant by domain
- [ ] Missing tenant header returns 400 on tenant-scoped endpoints

### 10.3 Per-Tenant Key Isolation

---

## 11. Social Login

### 11.1 OAuth Flow

- [ ] Callback with invalid state returns 400
- [ ] Callback with expired state returns 400
- [ ] State is consumed (replay protection) — reusing state returns 400

### 11.2 Identity Linking
- [ ] First social login creates external identity + internal subject
- [ ] Second login with same provider reuses existing internal subject
- [ ] Same user can link multiple providers
- [ ] Provider subject isolation: same email on different providers creates different links

### 11.3 ID Token Decode
- [ ] When userinfo endpoint fails, id_token is decoded for user claims
- [ ] ID token signature is validated against provider's JWKS
- [ ] Invalid id_token signature falls back gracefully (no crash)

### 11.4 Provider-Specific
- [ ] Google: discovery URL auto-configures endpoints
- [ ] GitHub: numeric user ID converted to string
- [ ] Apple: JWT client_secret generated with ES256 for token exchange
- [ ] Apple: `ExtraConfig` with `apple_team_id`, `apple_key_id`, `apple_private_key` used
- [ ] Generic OIDC: discovery URL fetches endpoints dynamically
- [ ] Generic OAuth2: manual auth/token/userinfo URLs used

### 12.2 Confirmation
- [ ] `POST /mfa/totp/confirm` with valid TOTP code confirms enrollment
- [ ] Confirm with wrong code returns 400
- [ ] Confirm with already-confirmed enrollment returns 409

### 12.3 MFA Challenge Flow
- [ ] When tenant MFA policy is `required` and user has enrolled:
  - `/authorize` returns MFA challenge instead of redirect
  - `POST /mfa/verify` with correct TOTP completes auth flow and returns code
  - `/mfa/verify` with wrong TOTP returns 400
  - `/mfa/verify` with expired challenge returns 400
  - `/mfa/verify` with already-verified challenge returns 400
- [ ] When MFA policy is `optional` and user is NOT enrolled: `/authorize` proceeds normally
- [ ] When MFA policy is `none`: `/authorize` never triggers MFA

### 12.4 TOTP Verification Details
- [ ] TOTP accepts code from current time window (30s)
- [ ] TOTP accepts code from ±1 time window (clock drift tolerance)
- [ ] TOTP rejects code from ±2 time windows
- [ ] Rate limiting on `/mfa/verify`: 21st request returns 429

---

## 13. MFA — WebAuthn/FIDO2

### 13.1 Registration

- [ ] Login finish updates sign count on credential
- [ ] Login finish with expired session returns 400
- [ ] Login finish with invalid assertion returns 400

### 13.3 MFA Challenge Integration
- [ ] When tenant MFA methods include `webauthn` and user has WebAuthn credential:
  - `/authorize` returns challenge with `methods: ["webauthn"]`
  - `/mfa/verify` with `method: "webauthn"` dispatches to WebAuthn verification
- [ ] `HasEnrolledMFA` returns true when user has either TOTP or WebAuthn

### 27.1 Full Authentication Flow
```
1. Create tenant (RS256)
2. Create confidential client (auth_code + refresh_token)
3. Register user
4. Login user → session token
5. Authorize (with session) → auth code
6. Exchange code → access_token + refresh_token
7. Verify JWKS contains signing key
8. Introspect access_token → active: true
9. Refresh token → new tokens
10. Revoke refresh token
11. Introspect → active: false
12. UserInfo → user profile
13. Logout
```

### 27.2 MFA-Protected Flow
```
1. Create tenant with MFA policy: required, methods: ["totp"]
2. Create client
3. Register + login user
4. Enroll TOTP
5. Confirm TOTP with valid code
6. Authorize → MFA challenge
7. Verify MFA with TOTP → auth code
8. Exchange code → tokens
```

### 27.3 Social Login Flow
```
1. Create tenant
2. Create identity provider (mock provider for E2E)
3. Authorize with provider param → redirect to provider
4. Callback with code → identity linked + AuthCore code issued
5. Exchange code → tokens with social user's claims
```

### 27.4 Multi-Tenant Isolation Flow
```
1. Create tenant A (RS256)
2. Create tenant B (ES256)
3. Register user on tenant A
4. Verify user cannot login on tenant B
5. Create client on tenant A
6. Verify client not visible on tenant B
7. Issue token on tenant A
8. Verify token invalid on tenant B's JWKS
```

### 27.5 RBAC Flow
```
1. Create tenant + client + user
2. Create role "admin" with permissions ["users:*", "posts:*"]
3. Create role "viewer" with permissions ["posts:read"]
4. Assign "admin" role to user
5. Login + authorize + token exchange
6. Verify access_token has roles=["admin"] and permissions=["users:*", "posts:*"]
7. Assign "viewer" role too
8. New token has both roles and merged permissions
9. Remove "admin" role
10. New token only has "viewer" permissions
```

### 27.6 Device Code Flow
```
1. Create tenant + client (with device_code grant)
2. POST /device/authorize → device_code + user_code
3. Poll POST /token → authorization_pending
4. Authorize device (user enters user_code)
5. Poll POST /token → access_token
```

### 27.7 Password Reset Flow
```
1. Register user with email
2. Request password reset OTP
3. Reset password with OTP + new password
4. Login with old password → 401
5. Login with new password → success
```
